Overview
========

qupled is a package that can be used to compute the properties of quantum one component
plasmas via theoretical approaches based on the dielectric formalism. The theoretical
approaches which can be solved with qupled include:

  * The classical STLS scheme as discussed by `Tanaka and Ichimaru <https://journals.jps.jp/doi/abs/10.1143/JPSJ.55.2278>`_
  * The classical STLS-HNC scheme as discussed by `Tanaka <https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/145/21/214104/196066/Correlational-and-thermodynamic-properties-of>`_
  * The classical STLS-IET scheme as discussed by `Tolias and collaborators <https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/155/13/134115/353165/Integral-equation-theory-based-dielectric-scheme>`_
  * The quantum STLS (QSTLS) scheme as discussed by `Schweng and BÃ¶hm <https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.48.2037>`_ 
  * The quantum QSTLS-IET scheme as discussed by `Tolias and others <https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/158/14/141102/2877795/Quantum-version-of-the-integral-equation-theory>`_

Limitations
-----------

Ground state (zero temperature) calculations are available only for the classical schemes (STLS, STLS-HNC and STLS-IET).

Units
-----

All the calculations are performed in normalized units. The wave vectors are normalized to the Fermi wave-vector and the frequencies are normalized to :math:`2\pi E_{\mathrm{f}}/h`. Here :math:`E_{\mathrm{f}}` is the Fermi energy and :math:`h` is Planck's constant.

Building qupled
---------------

Qupled is a hybrid C++/python code that can be built by using the CMake build system. The build process is summarized as follows:

.. code-block:: console

   git clone git@github.com:fedluc/qupled.git
   cd qupled
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   
This will produce the folder ``/build/qupled`` which contains the python package that can be used to solve the dielectric schemes. The build directory can be cleaned by running ``make true-clean``

Dependencies
------------

To build the code, the following dependencies must be satisfied:

  - `GNU Scientific Library <https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/>`_
  - `OpenMP (v5.0) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP>`_
  - `python::boost (v1.81) <https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_80_0/libs/python/doc/html/index.html>`_

To run the code, the following python packages must be installed

  - `matplotlib (v>=3.7) <https://matplotlib.org>`_
  - `numpy (v>=1.24)  <https://numpy.org>`_
  - `pandas (v>=2.0) <https://pandas.pydata.org>`_
