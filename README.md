# qupled: quantum plasmas's dielectric schemes

## Introduction

qupled can be used to compute the properties of quantum one component plasmas via theoretical approaches based on the dielectric formalism. The theoretical approaches which can be solved with qupled include:

* The classical STLS scheme as discussed by [Tanaka and Ichimaru](https://journals.jps.jp/doi/abs/10.1143/JPSJ.55.2278)
* The classical STLS-HNC scheme as discussed by [Tanaka](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/1.4969071)
* The classical STLS-IET scheme as discussed by [Tolias and collaborators](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/5.0065988)
* The quantum STLS (QSTLS) scheme as discussed by [Schweng and BÃ¶hm](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.48.2037)
* The quantum QSTLS-IET scheme as discussed by [Tolias and collaborators](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/5.0145687)
 
## Limitations

Ground state (zero temperature) calculations are available only for the classical schemes (STLS, STLS-HNC and STLS-IET).

## Units

All the calculations are performed in normalized units. The wave vectors are normalized to the Fermi wave-vector and the frequencies are normalized to 2&pi;E<sub>F</sub>/h. Here E<sub>F</sub> is the Fermi energy and h is Planck's constant.

## Documentation

The documentation is currently in preparation, but it can already be accessed on [Read the Docs](http://qupled.readthedocs.io/)
