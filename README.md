# qupled: quantum plasmas's dielectric schemes

qupled is a python package that can be used to compute the properties of quantum one component plasmas via theoretical approaches based on the dielectric formalism.  Information on how to build, run and use the code is available on [Read the Docs](http://qupled.readthedocs.io/)
