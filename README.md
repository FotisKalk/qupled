# Dielectric formalism for strongly coupled plasmas

## Introduction

STLS can be used to compute the static and thermodynamic properties of quantum one component plasmas via theoretical approaches based on the dielectric formalism. The theoretical approaches which can be solved with STLS include:

* The classical STLS approach as discussed by [Tanaka and Ichimaru](https://journals.jps.jp/doi/abs/10.1143/JPSJ.55.2278)
* The classical STLS-HNC approach as discussed by [Tanaka](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/1.4969071)
* The classical STLS-IET approach as discussed by [Tolias and collaborators](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/5.0065988)
* The quantum STLS (qSTLS) approach as discussed by [Schweng and BÃ¶hm](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.48.2037)
 
## Limitations

STLS can only be employed for finite-temperature systems. Calculations of ground state (zero temperature) properties will be implemented in the future.

## Compiling

The code can be compiled with gcc and with the [make file](Makefile) provided in the source directory. Please note that in order to correctly compile the code it is necessary that the following libraries are installed

* [GNU scientific library](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/). This library must be explicitly included by calling `make GSL="PATH"`, where `PATH` is the path to the folder containing the header files of the library. Alternatively, it is possible to change the default value of the GSL variable in the Makefile and then to simply compile via `make`.
* [OpenMP library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP). In most cases it is not necessary to explicitly include the path to this library. However, if this should be necessary, it should be possible to do so by modifying the `INCLUDE` variables which appear in the Makefile.

## Running 

Given a state point defined via the quantum degeneracy parameter (Theta) and via the quantum coupling parameter (r<sub>s</sub>), SLTS computes the static structure factor with the following procedure:

* For the classical schemes (STLS, STLS-HNC, STLS-IET)
  * The chemical potential is determined from the normalization condition for the Fermi-Dirac distribution function which is solved with a bisection method
  * The ideal density response is computed for various values of the wave-vector and of the Matsubara frequency
  * The static structure factor and the static local field correction are computed via an iterative solution which employs [mixing](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.1682399]) and is assumed converged if the condition 
||G<sub>i</sub>(x) - G<sub>i-1</sub>(x)|| < epsilon is satisfied between two successive iterations. Here G(x) is the static local field correction and epsilon is a tolerance specified in input


* For the quantum schemes (qSTLS, qSTLS-IET)
  * The chemical potential is determined from the normalization condition for the Fermi-Dirac distribution function which is solved with a bisection method
  * The ideal density response is computed for various values of the wave-vector and of the Matsubara frequency 
  * The fixed component of the auxiliary density response (defined as the product between the dynamic local field correction and the ideal density response) that does not depend explicitly on the static structure factor is computed and stored. 
  * The static structure factor and the part of the auxiliary density response that depends explicitly on the static structure factor are computed via an iterative solution which employs [mixing](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.1682399]) and is assumed converged if the condition 
||S<sub>i</sub>(x) - S<sub>i-1</sub>(x)|| < epsilon is satisfied between two successive iterations. Here S(x) is the static structure factor and epsilon is a tolerance specified in input.

All the integrals are computed with the doubly-adaptive Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature scheme as implemented in the [CQUAD](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/integration.html) function of the GSL library. Once the iterative procedure is completed, the results are written to a set of dedicated output files (see the section "Output")

The following command line options can be employed to control the calculations performed by STLS (the same information can also be retrieved by running stls with the option `--help`) :

  * `--dx` specifies the  resolution for wave-vector grid. Default `--dx=0.01`
  * `--iter`  specifies the maximum number of iterations to employ in the iterative procedure used to compute the static structure factor.  Default `--iter=1000`
  * `--min-err` specifies the minimum error for convergence in the iterative procedure used to compute the static structure factor.  Default `--min-err=1e-5`
  * `--mix` specifies the mixing parameter for iterative solution.  Default `--mix=0.1`.
  * `--mu-guess` specifies the initial guess for the bisection procedure used to compute the chemical potential.  Default `--mgu-guess=-10,10`
  * `--nl`  specifies the number of Matsubara frequencies.  Default `--nl=128`.
  * `--omp` specifies how many omp threads to use for the parts of the code that can be executed in parallel. Since the classical schemes can usually be run efficiently with a single thread, parallelization is available only for the quantum schemes. Default `omp=1`
  * `qstls-fix` specifies the name of the file used to load the fixed component of the auxiliary density response function. If a file name is not specified, the fixed component of the auxiliary density response is computed from scratch and a significant increase in the computational cost for the solution of the qSTLS scheme can be expected. Default `qslts-fix=NO_FILE` (no file is specified)
  * `qstls-guess` specifies the name of the file used as initial guess for the solution of the quantum schemes. If a file name is not specified, the iterative scheme is started by setting the auxiliary density response to zero (which is equivalent to set the dynamic local field correction to zero). Default `qslts-guess=NO_FILE` (no file is specified) 
  * `--rs`  specifies the  quantum coupling parameter. Default `--rs=1.0`.
  * `stls-guess` specifies the name of the file used as initial guess for the solution of the classical schemes. If a file name is not specified, the iterative scheme is started by setting the static local field correction to zero. Default `slts-guess=NO_FILE` (no file is specified) 
  * `--theory` specifies which scheme should be employed to compute the static structure factor. Default `--theory=STLS`. Accepted options are: 
     * `STLS` (classical STLS approach), 
     * `STLS-HNC` (classical STLS-HNC approach) 
     * `STLS-IET-IOI` (classical STLS-IET approach with the [IOI bridge function](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.46.1051))
     * `STLS-IET-LCT` (classical STLS-IET approach with the [LCT bridge function](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.46.1051))
     * `STLS-RIET-LCT` (classical STLS-IET approach with the [LCT bridge function](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.46.1051) with a rescaled coupling parameter defined according to [Bonitz](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5143225))
     * `QSTLS` (quantum STLS scheme). 
  
  
  * `-t` or `--Theta=1.0` specifies the  quantum degeneracy parameter. Default `-t 1.0` or `--Theta=1.0`.
  * `-x` or `--xcut=20.48` specifies the cutoff for wave-vector grid. Default `-x 20.48` or `--xcut=20.48`.
 
  ## Output 
  
  stls produces the following output:
  
  * One text file with the static structure factor (ssf_rs\*_theta\*\*\_\*\*\*.dat)
  * One text file with the static local field correction (slfc_rs\*_theta\*\*\_\*\*\*.dat)
  * One text file with the static density response (sdr_rs\*_theta\*\*\_\*\*\*.dat)
  * One text file with the normalized ideal Lindhard density response (idr_rs\*_theta\*\*\_\*\*\*.dat)
  * One text file with the static structure factor within the Hartree-Fock approximation (ssfHF_rs\*_theta\*\*\_\*\*\*.dat)
  * One text file with the interaction energy (uint_rs\*_theta\*\*\_\*\*\*.dat)
  * One binary file which can be used as an initial guess for subsequent calculations via the option `-f` (restart_rs\*_theta\*\*\_\*\*\*.bin)

In the above \* is corresponds to the value of the quantum coupling parameter, \*\* to the value of the quantum degeneracy parameter and \*\*\* to the dielectric approach that was solved.
